# satkit: Satellite Mission Analysis and Design

satkit is an open source Python package, aiming at providing an advanced functionality to solve satellite mission analysis and design as well as orbital mechanics problems, with enough precision and performance to be used in the design and operation of real satellites. The target audience is academics and amateur satellite community, including Cubesats (and anyone else who might be interested). It is built on the excellent open-source [Orekit](https://www.orekit.org) library (and the [Orekit Python Wrapper](https://gitlab.orekit.org/orekit-labs/python-wrapper)), but simplifying the interfaces for common use-cases.
