# Project Details

## Current Status

Current functionality:

- Loading a list of TLEs from file and filtering them for various parameters
- Initialise TLEs for common orbits (Sun-synchronous and geostationary)
- Adding further functionalities to basic Orekit classes like `AbsoluteDate` or `TLE`
- Good infrastructure for time interval management
- Harnessing the extensive [Orekit](https://www.orekit.org) functionalities (e.g., propagating orbits or finding events)

## About the Author

My name is [Egemen Imre](https://twitter.com/uyducusirin), the author of satkit. While this project has really been yet another excuse to learn Python for me, for more than 20 years I have been developing Orbital Mechanics software professionally for topics ranging from satellite mission analysis and design, to actual satellite operations.

## Acknowledgements

The folks at CS deserve praise for the excellent open-source [Orekit](https://www.orekit.org) orbital mechanics library written in Java. While the interface is occasionally mind-boggling, the breadth of functions is simply amazing. Petrus Hyv√∂nen has been maintaining the [Orekit Python Wrapper](https://gitlab.orekit.org/orekit-labs/python-wrapper), which opened the doors of Orekit to Python.
